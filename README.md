# TestRepo
I have a few ideas that I want to create to learn how to use html, javascript, and other languages. To help me I have a few project ideas that I will likley eventually spilt into seperate repositories:

# ThePokemonCardProject
The current idea behind the Pokemon Card Project is to create an algorithm that once it's given all the pokemon cards that we're counting, it will analyze which one is the most deserving of more cards.

Once I have that down, I'd like to make it into a website where others can mess around with it too. Then, maybe I'll make a big website that documents all the pokemon cards.

# ThePokedexChallenge
I want to create a website that lets you guess pokemon based on their pokedex entry. To do this, I'll need to create a database with all of the pokedex entries, which I would probably pull from current databases, and then compile them into a website.
