# ThePokemonCardProject
The current idea behind the Pokemon Card Project is to create an algorithm that once it's given all the pokemon cards that we're counting, it will analyze which one is the most deserving of more cards.

Once I have that down, I'd like to make it into a website where others can mess around with it too. Then, maybe I'll make a big website that documents all the pokemon cards
